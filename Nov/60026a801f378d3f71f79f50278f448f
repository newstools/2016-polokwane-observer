Rhinos, lions, elephants, and another five popular safari animals along with ranger Charlie and his 4&#215;4 vehicle, Buggy are part of a series of limited edition small toys called Stick Ems that are for sale exclusively in Checkers and Checkers Hyper stores nationwide to raise money for The Lunchbox Fund. The fun and sticky little South African-themed safari animals as well as Charlie and Buggy will retail at R4,99 and are sure to grab the public s imagination. It is expected that the special edition glow-in-the-dark rhino will be in big demand as these little chaps raise funds for a very deserving cause, says Checkers Spokesperson, Adele Kruger-Taljaard in a media release. A portion of the proceeds from every Stick Ems purchased will go to the Lunchbox Fund, which provides a daily nutritionally fortified meal to orphaned and at-risk school children in townships and rural areas of South Africa. Another way in which customers can lend their support to The Lunchbox Fund is by donating R5 or more to the #ActForChange Fund at any Shoprite or Checkers till point across the country. During October and November funds raised through this initiative will also go to The Lunchbox Fund. The #ActForChange Fund was launched in March in response to requests from consumers wanting to contribute to disaster relief initiatives in their local communities. To date the Fund has already raised over R750 000 for drought and hunger relief efforts through customer donations. &nbsp;
