The Man of the Match award he received on Sunday after their 2-2 draw against Baroka Football Club is of huge motivational value to Polokwane City Football Club striker, Rodney Ramagalela. He scored a goal in the first half and was instrumental in setting up of team mate Puleng Tlolane s second half goal. Ramagalela formerly played for Black Leopards and Mamelodi Sundowns. He dedicated his award to his teammates, his family and his followers for their support while he was injured. I spent a lot of time on the sidelines because of the injury, but my family was there and they helped a lot. I am grateful to everyone who helped me in those times, Ramagalela said. Unlike many strikers Ramagalela has not set a target for goals this season. All he wants to do is to help the team to finish the league in a respectable position. I don t want to put myself under pressure with targets and all that. We want to do well as a team this season and give our supporters value for their money. People pay to watch us play and all they want is good results. It our duty as players to give them what they want, Ramagelela said. Ramagalela has expressed the desire to play for South African senior men team, Bafana Bafana one day. It is every player s wish and I am no different. I was once called to the u.23 team in 2011 an it was a good and unforgettable experience but I have to work hard at my game in order for me to realise that dream, Ramagalela said.
