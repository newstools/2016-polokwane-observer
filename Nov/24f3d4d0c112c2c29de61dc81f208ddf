Bafana Bafana has never lost a match at Peter Mokaba Stadium, a fact Premier Stan Mathabatha pointed out on Saturday when he congratulated the national team on their victory against Senegal. Bafana Bafana made the country proud when they beat the Lions of Teranga 2-1 in a group qualifier match of the 2018 Fifa World Cup. Mathabatha said it had been expected to be a tough match and that they would either draw or win. On behalf of the Limpopo people I wish to congratulate the boys and the coach for a job well done. I also wish to invite South African Football Association to always consider Limpopo for their next matches, because they are guaranteed for a win here at home. Mathabatha also congratulated the Limpopo born players Hlompo Kekana, Tiyani Mabunda, Thabo Matlaba, Ramahlwe Mphahlele and Erick Mathoho for their professional show in front of the home crowd. He then congratulated the crowds for filling up the stadium. We called on them and they came in numbers. It was impressive, Mathabatha remarked.
