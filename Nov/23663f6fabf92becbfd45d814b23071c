MGM Group held their fourth blood drive for the year on Tuesday and staff members were keen to report at the mobile clinic. Among them was Creditor s Clerk at Land Rover Est Nel who achieved a milestone when she donated her 60th unit. The MGM Group has been a consistent and loyal partner of the service and hosts a number of blood drives each year to give new and regular volunteers the opportunity to donate Dottie Pinn, SANBS Limpopo Public Relations Officer said the service issues more than one million blood components annually. The service employs various educational strategies to inform members of the public and regular blood donors of issues pertaining the supply of sufficient, safe blood. The message of safe blood is disseminated through local and national media or conducting educational talks, Pinn said. Blood donor recruitment in South Africa is based on a World Health Organisation endorsed programme which specifies the selection of voluntary, non-remunerated blood donors. Low-risk blood donors are identified as volunteer blood donors who give blood solely to help those in dire need of blood, she said. Kgaugelo Mapoalo, Sales Representative for MGM Group said he donates blood because tomorrow he might need blood and it satisfies him knowing he can save someone s life. The number of units could not be confirmed at the time of going to print.
