Traffic on the N1 highway was deviated for several hours prior to an overpass bridge outside Polokwane along the route to Mokopane being demolished this morning (Wednesday). In the process traffic was relayed onto the R101 route, causing congestion that lasted up to about two hours. In an earlier statement the South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) notified road users that the route would be open again tonight at 18:00. The blast was part of Sanral s process of major upgrades and construction of the N1 ring road around Polokwane. The bridge had to make way for a new overpass to be constructed to accommodate the new N1 re-alignment, it was stated.
