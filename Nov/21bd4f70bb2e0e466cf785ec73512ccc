Following a 2-2 draw against Baroka on Sunday and their elimination from the Telkom Knockout competition by Mamelodi Sundowns last week, Polokwane City Football Club has no choice but to shift focus to their upcoming game against Bloemfontein Celtic set to take place on 20 November at Dr Molemela Stadium in Bloemfontein. City is currently in the 7th position of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) with 10 points after seven matches. Coach Luc Eymael is confident that they will do well against Celtic. We are doing well at the moment and that is the result of hard work and commitment shown by the players. We want to continue with the good performance, Eymael said. Since taking over at the club in July from Julio Leal, the Belgium mentor has only lost one match, that against Cape Town City Football Club in August. Eymael has attributed their terrific form in the league to hard work and the modern training method he introduced in the team. They are responding well to my training methods and that is a plus. Unlike other teams we don t have a big squad, we just have hard working players who are also very skilful and eager to contribute to the team, Eymael said He also added that their focus was to finish the league in the top 8 bracket. It is possible and it something the team has done before and I believe we can do it this season.
