Soccer fans from the province were privileged to see Bafana Bafana attain victory in their Group D match of the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Senegal at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday. The Lions of Teranga succumbed to Bafana Bafana 2-1 after goals by striker Thulani Hlatshwayo and Neteherlands based midfielder Thulani Serero in the first half of the match. Cheikh Tidiane Ndoye s goal in the second half brought little consolation for the Senegalese as their defeat gave Bafana Bafana four points after two matches in the group. Bafana Bafana Head Coach, Shakes Mashaba. Bafana Bafana Head Coach Shakes Mashaba credited the players for sticking to the game plan which resulted in the victory. We played according to our game plan. We did our homework on Senegal. They boasted world class wingers in Sadio Mane, now playing for Liverpool, and Keita Balde (Lazio) on the left. They are physically bigger than our boys they oozed class in the manner in which they played the ball out of defence, Mashaba said during the post match conference. I will like to congratulate the boys for the wonderful job. They did well throughout the match and they defended the goals. We came in the match knowing what to expect, we knew they would come at us very strong. We spoke about long balls into the box and we were able to deal with them, Mashaba elaborated.
