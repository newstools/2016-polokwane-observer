Employees at MGM Motors were keen to donate blood during a donor clinic held at the Landdros Mar Branch last Thursday. The blood drive yielded 12 units of blood which, according to The South African National Blood Service (SANBS) Limpopo Public Relations Practitioner, Dottie Pinn would help to save the lives of 36 people. The SANBS issues over one million blood components annually. Pinn said many countries have introduced legislation that allows blood donation only by voluntary non-remunerated donors. This is only achieved through the establishment of an effective programme of blood donor recruitment and retention. She explained that blood donated by a volunteer donor is treated with the utmost respect, as each unit of safe blood given is invaluable to patients who are in dire need of this precious resource. Each unit is subjected to strict and rigorous testing and processing procedures before being released for use. Callie van Heerden, Sales Manager MGM Motors Peugeot, Citro n and Mahindra Polokwane said that he first donated blood years ago because of a friend that needed a transfusion. Blood is essential in the treatment of many serious illnesses and it is important that South Africa has sufficient blood available for all patients. Blood and blood products are used, among others, for open-heart surgery, burn victims, newborn babies and in the treatment of diseases such as leukaemia and cancer, Pinn reminded.
