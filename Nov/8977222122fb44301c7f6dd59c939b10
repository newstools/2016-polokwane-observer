B rakhah 4&#215;4 Polokwane last Thursday held a networking event for local motor dealerships and selected customers to celebrate the fact that they are now the only agent and Platinum Dealer for Ironman 4&#215;4 in Limpopo. On Friday and Saturday the public were invited to visit the B rakhah 4&#215;4 Polokwane shop, meet the Ironman 4&#215;4 team, inspect the Ironman 4&#215;4 vehicles on display and enjoy great savings on Ironman 4&#215;4 vehicle accessories and packages. B rakhah 4&#215;4 Polokwane has been in business for almost 20 years and boasts 19 years experience in this ever growing industry. The fully equipped workshop with highly trained personnel can handle the fitment of all 4&#215;4 accessories, while customers can find anything from a 12 volt fridge to maps of Southern Africa in the retail shop. The personal touch and sage advice from owner Dirk Visagie makes B rakhah 4&#215;4 Polokwane a sanctuary for adventurers. People who want to travel through Southern Africa are welcome to drop by for some personal advice. Visagie has seen it all and done it all and he can even help travellers to work out the perfect itinerary, says Dawid van Heerden, Store Manager. In 1958 the Ironman 4&#215;4 brand of springs and suspension parts was launched in response to the increasing popularity of 4&#215;4 vehicles, recognising that standard suspension systems were not designed to cope with the additional loads of bull bars, winches and extra fuel tanks. The Ironman 4&#215;4 range of products expanded quickly to meet the demand of off road users seeking solutions which would allow their vehicles to go off road loaded with accessories such as winches, recovery equipment, protective bars, canopies, lighting and electrical upgrades. Many fleet and military organisations throughout the world have acknowledged the quality design and manufacture of Ironman 4&#215;4 products. With B rakhah 4&#215;4 Polokwane now a Platinum Dealer of Ironman 4&#215;4, it is a match made in heaven. The workshop is also well equipped to install any Ironman 4&#215;4 product and ensure the customer s peace of mind in all circumstances. We want to encourage the motoring industry and 4&#215;4 enthusiasts to visit us to see what we have to offer. B rakhah 4&#215;4 Polo kwane personnel are well trained and equipped to sort out even the most challenging problems, says Visagie.
