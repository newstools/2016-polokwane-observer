The N1 bypass in the vicinity of the Mall of the North off-ramp is closed in both directions due to a collision between two trucks about an hour ago today (Friday). According to a source the driver of one of the trucks allegedly crashed into the rear of another, reportedly stationary at the time, truck. Medical personnel are still on the scene. The two occupants of the truck which collided with the other had to be rescued from the cabin. They are seriously injured. It is not yet clear how long the road will remain closed, the source said. Traffic Liaison Officer of the Department of Transport and Community Safety Kagiso Mootane could not confirm the accident yet. We caution motorists to be alert on the roads especially now with the weekend starting and many shoppers still rushing to shopping complexes to benefit from Black Friday specials. The R555 at Steelpoort was also closed for about four hours this morning after an accident between a truck and a sedan, Mootane said. She said the driver of the sedan allegedly overtook another vehicle unsafely and collided with an oncoming truck. The sedan was stuck underneath the truck and caught fire. The two occupants in the sedan died on the scene, she said.
