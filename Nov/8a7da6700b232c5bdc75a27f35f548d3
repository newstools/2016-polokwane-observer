Baroka Football Club will need to cause a major upset when meeting Super Sport United Football Club at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday. United currently lies in second position of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) with 15 points after eight matches, while Baroka is in tenth position with nine points after eight matches. Baroka Spokesperson Jimmy Ngobeni said they are confident that they will do well against the high flying United. We are in this league to compete for titles and we don t want to add numbers. We are aware of their form in the league and we like playing against teams like them because we always do well against such teams. They beat us in the Nedbank Cup in April and that did not sit well with us. What we want is to win the match on Saturday, Ngobeni said. He said at present there are no casualties in the team and all players will be available for selection. We have ensured that we create a relaxing environment for the team ahead of this fixture. We played tough matches before the Fifa International break which took a lot out the team. We are glad that we have recuperated within a short space of time and we are rearing to go, Ngobeni said. Kick-off is scheduled for 15:30 and gates at the stadium will open at 12:00.
