Grade 7 learners of Flora Park Comprehensive Primary School recently shared their future career options with their parents, fellow learners and educators at the school. It seems a whole bunch of doctors and specialists in the medical field will be coming from this school in future. Two engineers and a tourism organiser spoke to the learners about their careers, what it entails and what it takes to qualify in their field prior to some learners contributing to the discussion. They spoke about the reasons for their interest in a specific career, the subjects one would need, how long and where one can study to qualify in the chosen field as well as where one could work with the qualifications. Learners then staged two light-hearted plays, one with Ebola as theme and the other Fly Woman depicting the result of a scientist s experiment that went wrong. Both depicted what specific people in specific careers could do to assist or how they could become involved in the unfolding stories, while other learners made a stage appearance when the career they were interested in was mentioned.
