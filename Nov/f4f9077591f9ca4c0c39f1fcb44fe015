He also indicated that participation in the competition boosted them in the league because they played against strong opponents. We played Platinum Stars and they are a strong team. The competion has showed us our strength and weaknesses and given us that competitive edge, Mammila said. He stated that they are already well prepared for their clash with Super Sport United at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on 19 November in their ninth match of the Premier Soccer League (PSL). United are currently in second position of the league while Baroka occupies the 10th with nine points after eight matches. We are aware of their form in the league but football is football. It is about who rises to the occasion and we are ready for them. It is our home match and we have to win the match, concluded Mammila.
