In an effort to promote the use of e-tags, officials of the South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) visited the province last week and shared information regarding the use of e-tags at a mobile information centre in the overflow parking area of Mall of the North. An information desk was also located in the Mall of the North where a scale model of the recently built intersection on the R71 at Zion Christian Church (ZCC) at Moria was on display. Officials of Sanral provided visitors with complementary e-tags loaded with a R50 credit and guided them through the activation process. The e-tags may be used at any toll gate.
