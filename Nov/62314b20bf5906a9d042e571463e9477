In their quest to attain thus far elusive Premier Soccer League (PSL) status, Black Leopards last week appointed former Nigerian national soccer team coach Jean Francois Luscuito as its new coach. The Belgian international takes over from Zimbabwean mentor Jairos Tapera who vacated his position last month due to poor results. Club Spokesperson Berry Ramunenyiwa said they wanted someone to fill the position left by Tapera and Luscuito was the right man for the job. We wanted a South African coach but they are occupied at the moment. He coached Togo and other African countries and we are confident that he will deliver, Ramunenyiwa said. Asked about his mandate at the team, Ramunenyiwa said it was to promote the team to the elite league. His mandate is the same as that of other coaches and that is to ensure that the club is promoted to the PSL. We want to go back there. We are aware that it won t be easy but we will keep on trying, he stressed. He also informed that they parted ways with lethal striker Roggert Nyundu on Monday. Nyundu who joined Leopards from Polokwane City Football Club in 2013 was part of the Bafana Bafana team that took part in the African Nations Championship match against Angola last year. He has been handed his clearance papers and he is free to join any team, Ramunenyiwa said.
