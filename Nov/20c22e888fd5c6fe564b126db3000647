When Black Leopards Football Club goes up against Mbombela United at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday they have but one option and that is to win. Lidoda duvha started the 2016/17 National First Division (NFD) campaign well but has dropped crucial points along the way. In their last three matches they suffered two losses, 2-3 against Stellenbosch Football Club and 0-2 against University of Pretoria Football Club but managed a 1-1 draw against Cape Town Stars. The results have seen Leopards dropping from 5th position of the division to 9th position with 12 points after 10 matches. This is one of the most crucial games for us. We have to win it and go back to that winning streak so that we do not go to the bottom of the log, Black Leopards Spokesperson Barry Ramunenyiwa said. He further stated the reason they are finding it difficult to win some of the matches is because they are a team to beat. Every team wants to beat us and that is a concern for us. Whenever they play against us they ensure they do well and it is up to us to us to ensure that we also rise to the occasion and come out of the game with maximum points, Ramunenyiwa said. He also indicated that they have not appointed a Head Coach following the departure of Jairos Tapera a fortnight ago. We haven t appointed anyone yet. Sello Chokoe is still in charge of the team on an interim basis and we are confident that he will do well while our search for a coach continues, concluded Ramunenyiwa.
