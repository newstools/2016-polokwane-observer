Polokwane residents and historic motorcycle enthusiasts were treated to some old-style racing action when members of the South African Historic Motorcycle Group (SAHMG) visited the Go-kart track on Saturday. Bikes dating back as far as 1872 were not only on show but also seen in action around the race track. Well over 20 classic motorcycles were on show and makes such as Manx Norton Commando, Suzuki GSXR dating back to the 80s and Honda MiniTrail were among the favourites. SAHMG has over 80 riders and associate members owning a variety of makes from Manx Norton to Gold Stars, Ducati, Triumph, BSA, Velocette, Greeves, Moto Guzzi, Yamahas, Suzuki and Kawasaki as well as more exotic machinery, such as Yamaha 250, 350 and TZ750 as well as Rob North Triples. The bikes were manufactured prior to December 1975 and most have racing histories. Some took part in racing events prior to the Second World War.
