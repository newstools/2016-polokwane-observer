The Management of Baroka Football Club is convinced of victory coming their way when they take on Orlando Pirates in their 11th match of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) on 30 November. Baroka s confidence is buoyed by their 1-1 draw against Super Sport United at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday. New Super Sport United striker Thabo Monyamane scored in the first half while sensational Richard Matloga converted for Baroka in the second stanza of the match. Club Spokesperson Jimmy Ngobeni said they are more than ready for Orlando Pirates. No one gave us a chance against Super Sport United because of their current form in the league. We did well and contained them throughout the match. We could have won the match but we were unable to convert our chances, Ngobeni said. We are ready for Pirates. It is one of the oldest teams in Africa and very strong. They have never been relegated and have always finished in the top 8 bracket. Although we respect them we are not afraid of them and remain confident of victory, Ngobeni said. He also stressed that it was important to win the match and better the team s home record. Since the beginning of the season we have never won any home game. We lost two home matches against Bidvest Wits and Chippa United in September and I think we can do better. We owe a home victory to our supporters and it is time we give them what they need, Ngobeni said.
