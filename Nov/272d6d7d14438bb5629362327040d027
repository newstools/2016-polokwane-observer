Once-off allocations The additional funds allocated to departments are meant to address provincial priorities that are of once-off in nature and may not be available over the MTEF period. Tooley said all departments will be consistently monitored to ensure that their budgets are managed effectively, economically and efficiently. Treasury shall continue to implement stringent cost cutting measures and consolidate the implementation of sound fiscal practise to strengthen the people s confidence in the economy. The province s development agencies will be engaged to ensure appropriate return on investment with the objective of making these institutions self-sustainable in the short to medium term. The Treasury is of the opinion that the current budget cuts will not impact on the province s ability to deliver the necessary quality services to the people of Limpopo.
