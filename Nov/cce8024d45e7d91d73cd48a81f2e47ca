Mall of the North (MoN) management on Friday brought great excitement and joy to fans of Bafana Bafana when they created an opportunity for supporters to meet the players and have their memorabilia signed by their heroes. Upon the arrival of the squad they were led by Sport, Arts and Culture MEC Onicca Moloi to the Edgars Court where they had a quick photo session with their fans. It seemed as if the traditional signing of T-shirts has become a thing of the past as most fans preferred to take selfies with the players. The players took a quick tour through the mall after which they left to prepare for their crucial 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifier against Senegal at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday.
