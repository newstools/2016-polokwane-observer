The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Limpopo intends to open a criminal investigation against senior officials in the Departments of Health, Education as well as Economic Development, Environment and Tourism who have contributed to the staggering R7,6 billion in unauthorised and wasteful expenditure in the province the past three financial years captured in the most recent Auditor-General report released on Wednesday. In a media statement issued today (Friday) DA Provincial Leader Jacques Smalle mentioned reference in the AG report to the same officials further failing to account for 76% of the provincial budget. It is clear that the ANC government will not hold financial misconduct to account, and therefore the DA will proceed to approach law enforcement. According to DA Limpopo Media Officer America Ngwepe the DA in the province was busy compiling a report with the necessary information before the intended registering of a case in Polokwane next Tuesday or Wednesday.
