During the Athletics South Africa (ASA) elections meeting recently held in Gauteng, Limpopo Athletics (Lima) President Tshifiwa Makhosi was elected to serve on ASA Track and Field Commission as additional member. In a telephonic interview with Makhosi she said it is an honour to be elected as member of the commission. I hope my role as member will play a big part in the development of athletics in the rural Limpopo. Our rural areas offer so many talented athletes but they do not have access to any facilities. I would also like to put in effort in lifting track and field items to an international level, she said. She also congratulated Lima committee additional member Esther Malema for also being elected as additional member of ASA board. During the election meeting ASA President Aleck Skhosana indicated that trail running will from October be realigned under the commission of cross country. ASA deliberated in 2015 on the issue of trail running and gave a clear directive to the ASA trail running committee to implement the alignment of fixtures and programmes under the cross country commission. The cross country commission will have to drive the realignment of trail running as of 24 October and that trail running will submit to the rules and statues of ASA. On this Makhosi said the incorporation of trail running under the commission of cross country will only yield positive results. Trail running and cross country create a platform for young and old. It is a mass participation sport and will now be properly managed to make easy selections of outstanding athletes to grow and excel in the sport, she said.
