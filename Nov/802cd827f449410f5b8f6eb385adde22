Medical practitioners from Mediclinic Limpopo on Friday set up shop in a local mall to reach out to the community of Polokwane. Visitors to the mall had the opportunity to have their blood sugar levels, cholesterol and blood pressure checked by trained professionals. They were also educated on the dangers of diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels and each received a leaflet with the necessary information to empower them to make the changes needed to ensure better health. The Medical Practitioners also spent some time with each patient to give them personal advice and emotional support where needed. Each person who visited the Mediclinic stall also received a health card with the date and their vital statistics written on it. This card can be taken to their regular doctors or clinics for information during follow up visits. Istha McMillan, Patient Experience Manager of Mediclinic Limpopo, said the hospital held these outreaches every year and it was wonderful to see people bringing in their health cards from last year to this year s outreach clinic to compare and see how their health has improved or deteriorated.
