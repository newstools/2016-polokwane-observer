Learners of Pfunanane Academy in Modjadjiskloof were overjoyed recently when they could take possession of brand new additions to their school thanks to the Hillary Group of Companies. Karen Abrie, Administration Manager at the Hillary Group of Companies says the group donated all the material needed to build the two Senior Phase classrooms as well as boys and girls bathrooms at the school as part of their Corporate Social Investment (CSI) programme. Pfunanane Academy is a private English medium primary school that caters to 300 learners. Many are orphans and vulnerable children whose tuition is paid by benefactors. Abrie explains that the Hillary Group of Companies has a CSI committee that reviews all applications for assistance. We never give money, but rather donate building materials as needed. In this case a construction firm from Tzaneen sent us a list of all the materials required and we donated it to the project, she says adding that the applications for assistance undergo a strict vetting process before decisions are made. Building started in February and the new buildings were ready for use in October. This is part of the Hillary Group of Companies CSI programme for the 2016 financial year.
