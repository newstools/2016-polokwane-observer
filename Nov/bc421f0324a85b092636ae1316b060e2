He has also played for Black Leopards Football Club and is a former learner of Pietersburg Comprehensive School. I played my first Premier Soccer League match here at Peter Mokaba Stadium and now also my first international match so I can t be happier, he said after the match. He stressed that he was grateful for the opportunity he has was given by Head Coach Shakes Mashaba to start in the qualifier match. It was a good experience. I enjoyed playing in front of the packed stadium against international top players like Sadio Mane, Mahamed Diame and Kalidou Koulibally. The supporters were amazing, they came out in numbers to cheer us on. As a team we are proud and grateful to have made them happy too, Mabunda said. Mabunda was part of Mamelodi Sundows team that won 2015/16 Premier Soccer League in May and also he also helped his team to win the Confederation African Football (CAF) Champions League title in Cairo in October.
