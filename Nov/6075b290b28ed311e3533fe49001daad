The Mokgolobotho family held a thanks giving ceremony for their 15-month-old boy Mogale, which means the brave one at their house in Polokwane on Saturday. An excited Thivhileli Mokgolobotho, mother to Mogale said with the ceremony they wanted to thank God for blessing them with another child following the death of her baby in 2012. We have two other children Molei, 16, and Molefe who is nine. With the ceremony we wanted to thank God for blessing us with Mogale because we lost a baby boy who just died few days after his birth and we were hurt. We never thought we would never have another child. We prayed to God for another baby and he blessed us with Mogale, hence the celebrations, Mokgolobotho said. As part of the celebrations the family invited Bolubedu cultural dance group who enthralled the neighbours and invited guests with their cultural songs.
