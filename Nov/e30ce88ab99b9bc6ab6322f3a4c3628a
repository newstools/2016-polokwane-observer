One of the city s flagship events, the Mayoral Charity Sport Event will be hosted by the Polokwane Municipality on 25 November. This event offers businesspeople a chance to interact with Polokwane Executive Mayor Thembi Nkadimeng and at the same time help raise funds for needy families, including students at tertiary institutions. The Mayoral Charity Golf Day will also be held on the same day. Golfers are requested to support the event which will be in the format of a four-ball individual Stableford for ladies and gents. Tee-off will commence at 07:30. The cost will be R5 000 per four ball alliance and funds generated will go towards charity. See contact numbers for more information below. The event is aimed at raising a substantial amount of money that will be shared equitably amongst charity organisations within the Polokwane municipal area. The success of the event depends largely on the involvement and contribution of the sponsors and businesspeople who partner in improving the lives of our people, Henry Lubbe, acting Municipal Manager said last week. He requested companies and organisations to support the initiative by joining hands with the Municipality and make way for the executive management of the municipality to interact with companies. A number of corporate sponsorship packages have been designed to suit the need of company s corporate needs and to ensure maximum exposure to the media and other stakeholders in the business fraternity are available, ranging in price. Any other form of sponsorship will be welcomed. The benefits and package for sponsors will be discussed in line with the magnitude of the sponsorship supplied.
