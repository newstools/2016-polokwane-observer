Newly promoted National First Division (NFD) outfit Magesi Football Club on Monday appointed Zimbabwean international, Shepherd Murape as head coach of the team. Murape takes over from Jacky Ledwaba who promoted the team from the ABC Motsepe League in May but failed to make an impact in the NFD. The Moletjie outfit has had it hard in their first season as they are lying at the bottom of the NFD log with a mere five points from nine outings. They suffered their 6th loss of the season to Milano Football Club in Cape Town on Saturday. Chief Executive Officer John Mathibe said that it was necessary to add some experienced personnel to the team before it is too late. Shepherd has been around for a long time and we feel that his experience and knowledge will be very valuable to club. We have played the past few matches without a head coach on the bench following the disappearance of Jacky Ledwaba and his subsequent disciplinary hearing. He has been attending to some personal issues and unfortunately for us the business must go on, explained Mathibe. He also added they could have chosen any coach but opted for Murape because he has a wealth of experience in the hot seat. He coached the Zimbabwean and Namibian national teams, Bloemfontein Celtic, Orlando Pirates as an assistant to Mike Makaab, and Moroka Swallows. However, the interesting side of his coaching career is the relationship he has always had with the Limpopo teams having coached Black Leopards, Ria Stars, Real Rovers and Dynamos. He also has vast experience in the NFD having coached United Football Club and Witbank Spurs, concluded Mathibe. Story: Herbert Rachuene &gt;&gt;herbert@mailbox.co.za Featured photo: Shepherd Murape.
