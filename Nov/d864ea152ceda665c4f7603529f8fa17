Shoppers at Mall of the North on Saturday received a pleasant surprise when Tom Naud Technical High School learners took part in a flash mob, performing in several places in the mall. The school s revue group donned their costumes and performed a few selected items from their show, stopping some shoppers in their tracks to take photographs and videos of the spectacular performances. A flashmob is a group of people who assemble suddenly in a public place and perform an unusual act for a brief time often for the purposes of entertainment and artistic expression. Tom Naud educator Karin de Jager accompanied the learners and said they thoroughly enjoyed the exposure and were happy to show the public what they could do. They were also supported by educators Antonette Jordaan and Carla Booysen, who also choreographed the revue. Their performance of Uptown Funk was a huge crowd favourite while Larissa Jansen van Rensburg, Dion Cilliers and Inne-Cori Haasbroek impressed with their rendition of Afrikaans song, Tussen Treine .
