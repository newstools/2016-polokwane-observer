It is expected that by tomorrow (Friday) the full extent of the leak of the National Senior Certificate matric Mathematics 2 exam paper will have been determined and those affected notified to rewrite this specific examination. The leak of the exam paper was uncovered at the Giyani High School on 31 October. A 52-year old suspect was arrested in connection with the leaked exam paper after he handed himself over to the Hawks at the Giyani Police station on Tuesday. The man was expected to appear in the magistrate s court yesterday (Wednesday) on charges which include theft. A joint press release issued by the Hawks and the Department of Basic Education stated that the investigation led the Hawks to Gauteng where several people provided statements and they then tracked the origin of the leaked exam paper back to Limpopo. Elijah Mhlanga, spokesperson of the Department of Basic Education said it must be made clear that there is no need for learners to panic as only those who found to have had access to the paper will have to rewrite as the initial investigation indicates that the leak was contained among a small group of learners. Mhlanga said the speedy work of the Hawks is extremely commendable and illustrates the seriousness of the crime compromising the integrity of the examination process that affects lives and futures of young people.
