Limpopo Police believe they might have cracked a hijacking syndicate following the discovery of more counterfeit shoes during an operation by the provincial tracking team in Musina last night (Wednesday). This after earlier success when the tracking team confiscated a truck carrying 945 boxes of shoes worth R1,2 million on the N1 North outside Polokwane on Tuesday. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said investigations led Police to a house in Musina which was searched. Police found 111 boxes of Soviet shoes, the same brand as those confiscated the previous day from the truck, 528 boxes of body lotion, 67 boxes of DVD players, 10 boxes of wrist watch batteries, five cell phones and a vehicle allegedly used to transport the goods was also impounded. A 30-year-old Ethiopian man was arrested on a charge of possession of suspected stolen property. It is believed that the shoes were hacked during a hijacking in Durban recently while the body lotion might have been stolen during a hijacking of a truck in Germiston last month, Ngoepe said. He added that the possibility of the incidents being linked is still under investigation. Ngoepe indicated that the suspect will appear in Musina Magistrate s Court before the end of the week while the two suspects, an Ethiopian and Somali national who were arrested on Tuesday, are expected to appear in the Polokwane Magistrate s Court today (Thursday).
