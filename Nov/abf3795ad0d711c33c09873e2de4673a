Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe informed that the three allegedly overwhelmed Police officers who were serving them dinner. One of the officers was disarmed in the process but no shots were fired. The suspects, Papic Mashale, Thomas Mawashe and Benny Mathaba, all from Phalaborwa area, face charges of rape after an incident which occurred in the Namakgale area earlier this year. Anyone with information can contact the investigating officer James Espach on 082 576 0743 or the nearest Police station. Investigations continue.
