Chaos erupted at Frans Mohlala House this afternoon as disgruntled African National Congress members gained access to the premises demanding an audience with the leadership on a number of issues. Currently the group of an estimated 150 members from branches in the Waterberg region awaits feedback on, among others, audited membership processes ahead of the pending regional conference. *See story in Thursday&#8217;s edition of Polokwane Observer.
