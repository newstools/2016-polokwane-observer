The Department of Health on Tuesday issued a statement to inform the public about the non-functionality of some theatres, excluding a maternity theatre and one for emergencies, at the Polokwane Hospital due to maintenance processes as a result of chiller plants being dysfunctional. Service providers are on site and we have received an indication that they will complete the maintenance process by 5 December, Derick Kganyago, Spokesperson for the department informed. The Department will timeously communicate with the public should there be any delay on the completion date of this process. He said the department have however made arrangements that certain procedures be done at the Mankweng, Seshego and Lebowakgomo Hospitals in the interim. Our five regional hospitals are also capacitated to handle certain procedures and our surgeons will be utilising some of these facilities during this period. The hospitals are able to carry out the required procedures as illustrated by the recent intervention made by Steve Matshidza and his team of doctors where 30 patients were operated on at Tshilidzini Hospital, a regional hospital over a weekend. We must understand that our facilities are old and from time to time we will be forced to shut down certain divisions in order to perform the necessary maintenance. We appeal to the people of Limpopo to be patient with us during this period and whenever they encounter challenges they must contact their hospital Chief Executive Officer and the clinical managers.
