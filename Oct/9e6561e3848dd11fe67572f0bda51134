Ramongwana Primary School in the Makgodu Village some 25 km north of Polokwane, benefited from a visit from Joyce Mokoena, Oral Health Manager, Capricorn District and more than 20 dental therapists and oral hygienists from the Department of Health s oral health division in the district recently. The department was celebrating Oral Health Month with outreaches to different schools. Mouth Hygienist Veronica Mathebula said the department s outreach team serviced the school at regular intervals throughout the year and has already established a brushing group at the school at the beginning of the year where eight classes, from Grade R to Grade 3 were shown and are supervised to brush their teeth every morning at the school to reinforce the positive habit. The mobile dental unit of the department also visited the school for A-traumatic restoration, where teeth of grade 3 learners were extracted or plaque removed if necessary. All 712 learners at the school received a new tooth brush and tooth paste to take home. School Principal Michael Ngoepe said the appreciated the dental service very much. Ngoepe has been with the school since 2006 and has been principal since 2011. He enjoys his job and appreciated a comment on the neatness of the school and the school grounds. The school urgently needs books for its library and people who can assist can phone Ngoepe on 083 277 2516.
