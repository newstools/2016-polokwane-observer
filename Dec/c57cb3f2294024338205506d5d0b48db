The soccer boots worn by Baroka Football Club goalkeeper, Oscarine Masuluke during their match against Orlando Pirates at the Peter Mokaba Stadium last Wednesday will be auctioned off on 22 December at the stadium. Masuluke made history when he scored a spectacular goal in dramatic fashion with a bicycle kick in the sixth minute of additional time against Orlando Pirates and equalised for his team. Images of the action are still doing the rounds on social media. Speaking after the match, Man of the Match Masuluke said he couldn t believe he scored the goal. It was one of those moments of the match. I saw that we were trailing and time was no longer on our side. I then decided to go to their 18 yards area and help the strikers and I am glad to have scored that equalising goal, Masuluke said. Ngobeni said lots of people from all over the world have enquired about his boots since he scored the goal and it was then decided to auction them. The bid will start from R60 000 and the highest bidder will walk away with the soccer boots, club Spokesperson Jimmy Ngobeni said. The boots in question are Adidas, size 12.
