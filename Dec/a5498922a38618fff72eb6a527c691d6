Rosina Shoka, mother of Petrus Shoka, a seven-year-old boy found dead in a small river outside Thokgwaneng village in Ga-Chuene last Thursday admits that she has not made peace with what happened to her child. Petrus, a Grade 2 learner at Thokgwaneng Primary School, went missing from his home on 28 November. Rosina said the pain of losing her last born child was too heavy a loss for her to bear. I still can t believe my baby boy is no more and I hope the perpetrators will receive what is meant for them, she said. She described her late son as a jolly and bubbly person who was loved by everyone. He was funny and intelligent. He was playful and loved by his peers, she said. Petrus will be buried on Saturday at Thokgwaneng cemetery. He leaves behind his siblings, Tebogo (23), Dipolelo (19), his mother and father John Shoka. Rosina also stated that she was not happy with the conduct of Police officers during the court appearance of the suspect in Polokwane Magistrate s Court on Monday. According to Rosina she was kept at a certain courtroom for hours only to be told later that the suspect had already appeared. We arrived in the morning for court and were told the sitting would take place at 12:00. While waiting we were told that the suspect had already appeared. I am hurt by the behaviour of the Police and I am still asking myself why they are behaving like this. I wanted to be in the same court room with him but that did not happen, she said.
