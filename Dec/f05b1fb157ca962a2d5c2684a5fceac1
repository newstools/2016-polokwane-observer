The Mokopane Regional Court found African National Congress (ANC) Waterberg Regional Secretary Noko (Tolly) Mashamaite not guilty on charges of rape and bribery on Monday. Mashamaite was arrested in October in connection with a matter instituted by a 33-year-old complainant in April this year after an alleged incident at a hotel in Mokopane. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed that Mashamaite was found not guilty. According to reports three witnesses testified in court before judgement was given. Allegations of a conspiracy against Mashamaite seemingly exist after the reported airing of a recording in which the complainant in the case ostensibly claimed to have brought the case against Mashamaite for financial gain. In a press release by the African National Congress Youth League (Ancyl) Provincial Spokesperson Matome Moremi said the league noted the verdict. Ancyl is on record in previous statements that Mashamaite is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Our call for him to step aside was not personal. There are lessons to be learned from this. If the tapes were tested in court and found to be true, then it must be investigated with intentions of bringing to book those who are involved in the alleged conspiracy, Moremi said.
