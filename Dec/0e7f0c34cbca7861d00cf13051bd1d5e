The Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100 created an opportunity for residents to put their cars up for sale at a Park and Sell activity held in the overflow parking area of Mall of the North on Saturday. A number of vintage cars that included a 1966 Rolls Royce, a Studebaker and a 1965 Jaguar Mark 2 were on show. Co-organiser of the event, Eric Wood said depending on the demand the event may be held every first Saturday of the month from next year and other items such as trailers, caravans and four-wheelers may also be included.
