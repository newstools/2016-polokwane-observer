Eagle s Nest Christian School appointed a new Head of Department, Bertie de Lange, for the Intermediate Phase at the school following the decision of the in-office head, Chris Chapota to return to Malawi to establish a new Eagle s Nest Academy there. De Lange joined the school earlier this year and will take up his new responsibilities as from January 2017. He was formerly attached to Chris Hofmeyr School. After finishing his B Ed degree in 2005 he started working at Anton van Wouw School for a year and a half, before the lure of the Bushveld became too much and he relocated to Polokwane in 2007. I believe I have a calling at Eagle s Nest Christian School and that the Lord has big plans for me and my family. My spiritual life underwent tremendous change after completing the six week Foundation for Cross Cultural Education course recently De Lange said Eagle s Nest Christian School is built on three pillars of prayer, education and outreach, all involving teamwork showing the school s character of care and uniqueness. The school s vision is to equip and enable learners to develop their full potential as Christian leaders. All the above are values I subscribe to and think it is of high importance. He sees it as his main responsibility to help children realise their true strengths, building relations with parents and setting goals with standards.
