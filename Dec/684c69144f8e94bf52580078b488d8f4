Magesi Football Club secured their second victory in the National First Division (NFD) since their promotion to the division when they beat Amazulu 3-2 at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday. Promoted from the ABC Motsepe League in May Magezi have been struggling to find their feet to such an extent that out of 12 matches they have won only two, drew 3 and lost seven. This dismal display has put them in 16th position in the division. Hero Makgamatha, General Manager of the team said that they are relieved to finally collect points in the division. We must admit that it has been tough for us so you can imagine the feeling. We have been waiting for these three points more than anything else and we are excited and inspired to grind for more points, Makgamatha said. He attributed the results to the changes made by the team management last month. We have a new coach in Sheppard Murape and he is doing well. The team is responding well to his philosophy and we are hoping for more wins, Makgamatha said. He explained that their aim was to win all their remaining matches before the Festive Season break and thereby better their position in the division. We are left with three matches before the break which is a possible nine points that could put us in a respectable position. It is going to be tougher when we come back from the break so we have to collect those points now, Makgamatha said.
