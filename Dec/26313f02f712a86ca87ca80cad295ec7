Modimolle Police are investigating a case of culpable homicide after 11 people died in an accident on the N1 near the Nyl Toll Plaza last (Sunday) night. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said the accident occurred at about 22:50 when a Toyota Avanza and a truck collided head on. It is alleged that the truck was travelling south when the Avanza suffered a burst tyre causing it to swerve into oncoming traffic and colliding with the truck. Both vehicles caught fire. Ten occupants of the Avanza died instantly while one passed away in hospital, Ngoepe said. He added that most of the deceased were burnt beyond recognition in the wreckage while the truck driver sustained serious injuries to his legs. This accident brought the total number of road fatalities in the province from Saturday to yesterday evening to 22 and is a worrying factor for the Police. We urge motorists to take care on the roads and to double check roadworthiness of vehicles and to be patient as traffic volumes on the roads are steadily increasing, Ngoepe said. According to Ngoepe the Forensic Unit from Pretoria will conduct an investigation to determine the identities of the deceased.
