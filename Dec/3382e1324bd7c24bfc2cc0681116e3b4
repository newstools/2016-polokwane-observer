With incredible prices on all items in store, the OK Furniture opening at Savannah Mall on Friday was not to be missed. Shoppers eager to make the most of the grand opening sale started queuing from early morning to get their hands on wonderful savings such as a lounge suite for only R2 999 and a Telefunken 24-inch HD LED television with built-in DVD player for only R1 899. Store management ensured an easy flow of customers through the shop and with more than enough of each item in stock, there was no need for worry and everybody left the story happy and satisfied, ready for the Festive Season. Daphney Matlou, who came all the way from Mokopane for the grand opening said that she was very impressed with the deals in store. It feels as if it is a special early Christmas just for me, she said. Another customer, Culwick Mojapela said the organised way in which the sale was managed was commendable. It is also very nice to have people greet you at the door and direct you to where you need to be without having to walk around feeling lost, he said. Sam Radupe, Regional Manager for OK Limpopo Central who was in charge of the store opening with Store Manager, Karien van Niekerk said he was proud of the store and happy with the turnout at the grand opening. OK Furniture in Savannah Mall is accessible from Entrance 2 next to KFC.
