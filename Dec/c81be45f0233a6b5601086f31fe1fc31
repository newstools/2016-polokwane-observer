Polokwane Municipality earlier this morning informed residents by SMS that water shortages may be experienced in higher lying areas today due to damage caused by lightning to some of the plant on the main water lines. Acting Communications and Marketing Manager of the municipality Matshidiso Mothapo confirmed that water flow from Ebenezer Dam, the Olifantspoort pumping station and the borehole at the Potgieter Avenue reservoir was affected. Mothapo assured that the matter is receiving attention and should be rectified soon. Residents are again urged to use water sparingly, Mothapo said.
