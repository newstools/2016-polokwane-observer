Polokwane Executive Mayor Thembi Nkadimeng on Tuesday extended the city s warmest welcome to soccer lovers expected to attend the final match in this year s Telkom Knockout series between Super Sport United Football Club and Cape Town City Football Club at the new Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday. Nkadimeng said: This is the third time Peter Mokaba Stadium shall be hosting a major soccer event in 2016 after Bafana Bafana and the Nedbank Cup Final. It cements our position as a preferred sporting destination not just provincially but nationally. Polokwane has raised its hand and is now counted amongst the must-go-to cities as far as sporting is concerned, especially soccer. The growing partnership we have with the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture is paying dividends, bringing high profile activity like the Telkom Knockout Cup final. Being the Festive Season the final would also show those who are from outside Polokwane that there is a destination for tourism and sport. We are delighted and will continue as the municipality to make available the best facilities to host national events, Nkadimeng said. The onus is upon fans to buy tickets and fill the stadium to show the Premier Soccer League why we should remain a preferred destination irrespective of what teams are playing, she concluded.
