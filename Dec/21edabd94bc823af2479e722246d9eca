Two councillors of Polokwane Municipality that were ordered out of the disrupted monthly council meeting that took place yesterday (Thursday), will face the municipality s Ethics Committee as soon as a meeting can be convened in view of the fact that the council is already in recess until the next meeting in January. Matshidiso Mothapo, acting Communications and Marketing Manager of the municipality, confirmed that Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) councillors Len Meyer and Mike Ramaphoko were barred from attendance of the rest of the meeting that was resumed later on Thursday afternoon. Video material that was posted on Polokwane Observer s website shortly after the meeting was adjourned, showed how Meyer and Ramaphoko resisted removal after Speaker Mariri Ralafetane ordered municipal security personnel to escort the two councillors from the council chamber. Other councillors joined in the fighting and while fists flew, water bottles and red safety hats were used as weapons. Furniture and equipment were also damaged before Ralefatane adjourned the meeting after 30 minutes of altercations. The presence of a crowd of supporters in EFF regalia that took up most of the public gallery, encouraging their political leaders, did not contribute to the calming of emotions. I think this whole parade was planned because the supporters arrived in a group and even brought along their own banner that was concealed, a member of the public that wished to remain anonymous, remarked. The reconvened meeting took place without further interruptions with a broken chair and the damaged main door to the council chamber as the only sign of the drama that played itself out earlier.
