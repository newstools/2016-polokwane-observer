Six people were killed in three separate accidents in Limpopo last Thursday and Friday which resulted in the affected roads being closed for several hours. The most recent accident involving two trucks caused heavy delays on the N1 bypass close to the Mall of the North off-ramp on Friday as the road had to be closed in both directions for medical personnel to hep the injured. According to a source the driver of one of the trucks allegedly crashed into the rear of another truck, reportedly stationary at the time. The two occupants of the first truck were seriously injured. Earlier the same day a sedan collided with a truck and caught fire on the R555 outside Steelpoort. Traffic Liaison Officer of the Department of Transport and Community Safety Kagiso Mootane said the driver of a sedan allegedly overtook another vehicle and collided with an oncoming truck. The sedan got stuck under the truck and caught fire. The two occupants in the sedan died on the scene. The road was closed for about four hours, she said. Police in Groblersdal are investigating a case of culpable homicide after an accident between a Toyota Land Cruiser and Mazda sedan on the R33 outside Dennilton on Thursday. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said the vehicles collided head-on killing all four occupants of the Mazda instantly. The names of the deceased will be released later.
