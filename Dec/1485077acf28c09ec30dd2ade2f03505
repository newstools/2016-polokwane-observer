Eighty karatekas from Polokwa ne and as far as North West competed in the 12th annual Battle in the Bush All Style Karate do Championships hosted at Soke Henri Eksteen s dojo on Saturday. Fifty-six of the karatekas were from Eksteen s club while the remainder were from clubs in Brits and Rustenburg. The prestigious event is dedicated to my global affiliate s World President and Founder of the World Kobukan Federation Kizuna &amp; Brotherhood, Grandmaster Ronnie Colwell who passed away a year ago. The events to follow will be in memory of Colwell, a karate legend from Britain of which I am the proud South African Director to the organisation, Eksteen said. Eksteen added that he was overwhelmed at the number of parents and general public attending and supporting the event. The first place winners in respective divisions were bestowed with national colours.
