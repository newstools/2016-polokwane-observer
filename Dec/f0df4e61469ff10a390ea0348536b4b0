While the official launch of Operation Festive Season by Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba only took place in Modimolle on Tuesday, the men and women in blue have ceaselessly worked since the beginning of November to ensure a safe holiday period for all. Regular operations conducted have thus far yielded good results with several illegal items confiscated and the perpetrators put behind bars. The latest of these operations were conducted in Groblersdal, Seshego, Makhado and Lephalale last Thursday. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said a 33-year-old suspect was arrested in Groblersdal for possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. A 7,65 mm pistol and six rounds of live ammunition were confiscated. Police in Lephalale also arrested two Zimbabwean nationals aged 35 and 39 at Marapong on charges of housebreaking and theft. During their arrest a DVD player, a television and shoes were confiscated, Ngoepe said. Police also made a major breakthrough when they arrested a 28-year-old suspect for possession of drugs at Mamone Village outside Jane Furse. Hundred and fifty sachets of nyaope with an estimated street value of R7 500 and cash were confiscated, Ngoepe said. Meanwhile in Seshego a 21-year-old suspect was arrested for theft of cell phones and Police managed to recover one Samsun cell phone while a 29-year-old suspect was arrested in Makhado for possession of a 9 mm pistol and nine live rounds of ammunition. All suspects will appear before the respective courts during the week. We once again warn criminals that we as the Police will go the extra mile to make sure that they are removed from the streets of the province to ensure a safe and peaceful Festive Season , Ngoepe said.
