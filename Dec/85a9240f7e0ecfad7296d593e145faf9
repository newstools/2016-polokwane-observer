Following their dismal performance against Maritzburg United and their subsequent fifth loss of the season at the old Peter Mokaba on Sunday, Baroka Football Club have made a promise to their fans that they will win their match against Free State Stars when the two meet at James Motlatsi Stadium in Free State on Wednesday. Baroka are currently in 12th position of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) log with a meagre 11 points after 12 matches. In their last four matches they lost against Chippa United, Bloemfontein Celtic and drew against Orlando Pirates and Polo-kwane City Football Club. Spokesperson for Baroka Football Club, Jimmy Ngobeni said they are disappointed that they are unable to attain desirable results. We must admit that it has been tough lately. The problem is physiological, our players have a tendency of choosing matches. We play well against the big teams but we lose against teams that are on our level. We need to bring that attitude and approach to an end because we are dropping crucial points, Ngobeni said. He also mentioned that they have to win their match against Free State Stars in order to better their position in the league. This is a promise we made to our supporters .Our target before Christmas break is nine points and it all starts with Free State Stars. Then we are left with, Golden Arrows and Mamelodi Sundowns and we believe we can win those matches, Ngobeni said.
