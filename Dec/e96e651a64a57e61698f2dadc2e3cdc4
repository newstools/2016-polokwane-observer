When Polokwane Observer recently shined the spotlight on the financial predicament Aretha Home experienced, Mall of the North mall management immediately jumped into action. The mall and its tenants have in the past also reached out to the residents of Aretha by donating much needed supplies and this time they did not hesitate to lend a helping hand. Mall of the North Marketing Manager, Mari Delport and Public Relations Manager, Tabitha Lekganyane stopped by the facility last Thursday to deliver basic groceries like sugar, coffee, rice, pasta and cooking oil as well as a few items to make the Festive Season more fun, including biscuits and chocolates. Delport said the mall reached out to different charities throughout the year. When we heard about Aretha Home s predicament, we just had to do something, she explained. We encourage the Polokwane community to contact the home s management to find out what their most pressing needs are and how to help. Any donation would be welcome, no matter how small. Aretha Home Secretary Lizelle Bezuidenhout can be reached on 079 326 2909 for more information.
