The South African National Blood Service in Limpopo recently awarded businesses, schools and blood drive controllers for their dedication. Among the valued contributors towards the success of the service is Coca-Cola Beverages South Africa who received their award on Friday. Dottie Pinn, SANBS Limpopo Donor Relations Practitioner said Coca-Cola Beverages has been a great ambassador for the service. Pinn stated that the SANBS works four to six weeks in advance to book mobile donation clinics. She added that 60% of blood donated is collected by mobile clinics such as those at Coca-Cola Beverages. The company renders further support by supplying beverages to be given to donors during drives. Lindi van der Merwe, Coca-Cola Beverages Trade Marketing Manager for Limpopo said blood donation was the ideal way employees of the beverage giant to do their bit for the community. She also confirmed that Coca-Cola Beverages will continue to support the SANBS in 2017 by hosting regular donor clinics and supply SANBS with small cokes for their blood clinic during the festive season in Savannah Mall next to the Pick n Pay entrance.
