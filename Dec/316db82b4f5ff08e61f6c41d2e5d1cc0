The suspect is facing charges of possession of suspected stolen property after being caught in possession of three stolen vehicles valued at approximately R3 million. All vehicles were fitted with cloned registration numbers, Ngoepe said. He added that Police confiscated a Toyota Hilux, BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz S63.
