The Fiscal Development Directorate of the Provincial Treasury scooped two prestigious national awards earlier this year. The first was as winner of the Innovative Enhancements of Internal Systems of Government and included a trophy and R20 000 in prize money. The same project went on to win the 2016 Innovator of the Year award consisting of a trophy and prize money of R70 000. The total prize awarded to the Provincial Treasury amounted to R90 000. The department entered and participated the Centre for Public Service Innovation (CPSI) awards because of the Provincial Revenue Enhancement Strategy and was nominated and shortlisted in the category for Innovative Enhancement of Internal Systems of Government. The CPSI awards are open to all the provinces and comprise four categories. The winners are assessed and an Innovator of the Year selected to the highest prize. Spokesperson for the department Sydwell Sibanda in a press release said: In response to the current economic situation, Provincial Treasury in consultation with departments and public entities developed the Provincial Revenue Enhancement Strategy in 2013/14. The aim was that provincial revenue collection target should reach the R1 billion mark by the 2017/18 financial year from the target of R509, 9 million in 2012/13. The strategy was rolled out to departments and public entities through the various provincial government forums and through the implementation of the strategy, the actual revenue collection improved from R844,4 million in 2013/14 to R1,422 billion in 2014/15, a significant increase of R578 million. This translates to the achievement of the R1 billion mark target in the 2014/15 financial year as compared to the estimated period of 2017/18 financial year. Sibanda added that the R1 billion mark has since been sustained with the 2016/17 target of R1.5 billion. An increase in revenue collection augment the provincial budget pressures and contribute to an improved provision of services to the people of the province. Sibanda said.
