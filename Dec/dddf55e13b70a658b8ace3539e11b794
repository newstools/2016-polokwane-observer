Sasol Bendor hosted their second blood drive this year in conjunction with the South African National Blood Service (SANBS) last Wednesday. Ten units of blood were donated by clients and employees. SANBS Public Relations Practitioner, Dottie Pinn remarked that while the service is under constant pressure to deliver blood and blood products to satisfy the ever increasing demand, it is disturbing that less than one percent of the population are donors. The service must collect approximately 3 000 units of blood every day in order to meet the growing demand for this precious resource, she explained. She said in order to meet the challenge the brand needs to be trusted and respected as an essential service for all. The 10 units collected on the day will enable the SANBS to help 30 people, Pinn said. She said blood drives hosted by businesses make a valuable contribution towards maintaining the service s stock at n acceptable level. Donors must be between 16 and 65 years old, weigh more than 50 kg and maintain a sexually safe lifestyle.
