A 30-year-old taxi driver from Moletjie was expected to appear in the Seshego Magistrate s Court on Tuesday after he allegedly shot and killed another taxi driver, presumably after an argument over a client on Sunday. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the suspect s appearance in court but could not provide any further details. An eyewitness told Polokwane Observer that the incident occurred close to the Seshego Police Station. One of the drivers is responsible for local commuters, while the other one provides services to Polokwane. The Polokwane driver allegedly offered a local commuter a ride after which an argument erupted between the two drivers, one accusing the other of stealing his clients, he said. The witness said that both men got into their respective taxis and drove off. At the traffic light the one driver stopped behind the other and got out, opened the door of the other taxi and started assaulting the driver. He then produced a firearm and shot the driver. He further said that a man on a motorbike stopped at the scene and tried to disarm the furious taxi driver but was allegedly also shot at. The biker ran to the nearby Police station to report the matter. Police were on the scene quickly and the alleged shooter was arrested. Ngoepe said during the arrest Police confiscated a 7.65 mm pistol with two rounds of ammunition and an empty cartridge. He further confirmed that the incident occurred at the traffic light close to the Police station where a taxi driver was shot and killed behind the steering wheel of his vehicle. He could however not confirm the motive for the killing. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com &nbsp;
