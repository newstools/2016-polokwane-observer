A masked ball was the setting for the farewell function of the Grade 12 class of Jabez Christian Academy hosted at Adega Restaurant on Friday evening. Principal Elana Erasmus congratulated the learners on the successful completion of their school careers and said she had no doubt that they would all excel in their further studies and future positions in the community. She also extended a word of sincere appreciation to the staff members of the school that were instrumental in forming the characters of the learners. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed, Erasmus assured them. &nbsp; Story and photos: BARRY VILJOEN &gt;&gt;barryv.observer@gmail.com &nbsp; Featured photo: Jabez Christian Academy head girl Shoki Molala, head boy Wesley Mamopha and Alexsa Mthagadura take time to pose for a last photo with Principal Elana Erasmus fellow learners Dineo Mashishi, Donovan Bill and Simon Lowan in the second row and Samuel Hyera and Junior Mwasi at the back.
