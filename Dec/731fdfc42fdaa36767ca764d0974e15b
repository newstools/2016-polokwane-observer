Magesi Football Club will be looking to collect maximum points against Black Leopards Football Club when the two meet in the 14th match of the National First Division (NFD) set to take place at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday. Magesi are sitting precariously in the last position of the division with nine points after 13 matches while Leopards are riding high in seventh position of the log with 17 points. General Manager and Spokesperson for Magezi, Hero Makgamatha said a victory against Leopards will be a morale booster for the team. We have just come back from 2-1 loss against Cosmos on Sunday and it will be a shame if we don t win this match. It is the last second match before the Christmas break and we want to go in the rest period being in a better position. We know Leopards strength and weaknesses and it is one team we are not afraid off. The boys know what is expected from them and we are confident that they will deliver, Makgamatha said. Spokesperson for Black Leopards, Berry Ramunenyiwa said it will be difficult for Magesi to get points from them. We are already champions of Limpopo and what makes us even happier is that the team is settling well in the division. We have put most of challenges behind us. We recently drew against log leaders Thanda Royal Zulu and that is good for us, Ramunenyiwa said. Makgamatha called on their supporters to rally behind the team on match day. We are aware that we are not doing well in the division and we need our supporters because we also value them. Our promise to them is that we will win the match and move up in the division Makgamatha said. Story: Herbert Rachuene &gt;&gt;herbert@mailbox.co.za &nbsp;
