The Department of Health has deployed a high level team consisting of district managers and departmental heads of security to further investigate an alleged incident of rape and assault of security officers that reportedly took place on Tuesday at Mokgapheng Clinic in the Tzaneen area. It is alleged that a female security officer was raped while the male security officer was physically assaulted and disarmed by the perpetrators. Media Liaison Officer for the Department of Health, Thabiso Teffo said it was disturbing to learn that people tasked with the responsibility of ensuring the safety of the patients, staff members and health facilities are now being targeted by criminal elements. This further deals a huge blow to our efforts to render much needed 24-hour services at our clinics as nurses now fear for their safety. The MEC calls on the law enforcement agencies handling this matters to speedily arrest these perpetrators and she also calls on the community to defend and protect staff members at health care institutions, Teffo said. He also stressed that the department views acts of crime in a serious light and will fully cooperate with the law enforcement agencies to ensure that justice prevails. We will continue to support the female security officer who is currently undergoing treatment and counselling, Teffo said. Story: Herbert Rachuene &gt;&gt;herbert@mailbox.co.za
