Shoppers at Mall of the North were pleasantly surprised from Friday to Sunday when they were greeted by calming music at the restaurant entrance of the mall. Etu Javier Lopez entertained shoppers with his unique soothing sounds, transporting them to the jungles of South America or the mesas in North America, if only for a minute or two before they had to continue with their Festive Season purchases. Lopez explains that he was born in the USA and his father was of Chiricahua Apache and Lekota descent. He is proud to say that the famous Geronimo was one of his forefathers. His family move to Bolivia when he was very young and he grew up with the sounds of the Inca music. As Lopez grew up, he started to write his own music and blended the sounds of the Inca with the sounds of his father s people. He plays the sampo as pan fluits as well as other traditional native American instruments such as the quenachos and quenas, bamboo flutes with four to six holes in the front, one at the back and a u shaped notch at the mouth of the instrument. Today he is a full time musician who has moved to South Africa three years ago to quench his thirst for travel and knowledge. He lives in Johannesburg, but constantly tours the country to perform in malls and other venues. I like performing in malls. People are always so stressed when they have to do specific shopping, especially during the Festive Season. My music calms people down and helps them to relax, making their shopping experience a more pleasant one, Lopes explains, adding that he will be at Mall of the North again from 22 to 24 December.
