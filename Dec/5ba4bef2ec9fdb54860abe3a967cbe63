The Management and staff of Mother Goose Cr che and Pre-School in Westenburg bid farewell to their Class of 2016 during a mini farewell function held at the school on Saturday. The class had 40 learners aged between five and six years. As part of the day s celebrations the learners recited poems and sang gospel songs to entertain their parents and educators. Esnath Hove, educator described the learners as a bunch of happy souls who were exciting to teach. I enjoyed every moment with them. I enjoyed teaching them, playing games with them and even the naughty things they did during their time here at the school. It was great to have them and I wish them the best on their new academic journey.
